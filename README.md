# README

This was created with Create React App.

I avoided using many dependencies, but if I did choose to add them they would probably include Sass (not married to it but its what I'm used to), a form library, axios or some other alternative to native fetch, a date library to support timezones, TypeScript if the app was larger and more complex, etc.

If I had more time I would have:

- added more unit tests
- added more styling!
- responsive design and different layouts for desktop vs mobile
- more robust error handling and loading states
- a progress bar
